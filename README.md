Python code for plotting Fig. 5 in Kirsten et al. (GMD, 2023).
Land-atmosphere interaction diagnoses based on flux tower observational data (FLUXNET2015, Ameriflux, and drought-2018 network). The python scripts include data analysis and visualization of the entire diurnal cycle of heat/water energy budget within the boundary layer using Mixing diagrams (Santanello et al. 2009).
